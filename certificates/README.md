# Certificate images for your portfolio

The Certifications tab loads **4 images** from this folder. Use these **exact file names**:

| Save as        | Shown as (card title)           |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **cert1.jpg**  | AWS Solutions Architect         |
| **cert2.jpg**  | Azure Administrator             |
| **cert3.jpg**  | Terraform Associate             |
| **cert4.jpg**  | Kubernetes Administrator        |

## How to save your certificates

### 1. File names
- Name the files exactly: `cert1.jpg`, `cert2.jpg`, `cert3.jpg`, `cert4.jpg`
- Use lowercase and no spaces.

### 2. Format
- **JPG** or **JPEG** – preferred (smaller file size, works well for photos/screenshots).
- **PNG** – also works; if you use PNG, name them `cert1.png`, `cert2.png`, etc., and update the image paths in `index.html` (change `cert1.jpg` to `cert1.png` in the Certifications section for each card).

### 3. Where to save
- Put all 4 files **inside this folder**:  
  `portfolio/certificates/`
- So the full paths look like:
  - `portfolio/certificates/cert1.jpg`
  - `portfolio/certificates/cert2.jpg`
  - `portfolio/certificates/cert3.jpg`
  - `portfolio/certificates/cert4.jpg`

### 4. If your certificate is a PDF
- The site cannot show PDFs directly; it needs image files.
- **Option A:** Take a **screenshot** of the certificate (or the part you want to show), then save it as `cert1.jpg` (or cert2, cert3, cert4).
- **Option B:** Open the PDF, zoom so the certificate fills the screen, take a screenshot, crop if needed, and save as the right `certN.jpg`.
- **Option C:** Use a converter (e.g. online “PDF to JPG” or Preview on Mac: File → Export as JPEG) and save the page as the correct `certN.jpg`.

### 5. Size and quality
- A width of about **800–1200 px** is enough for clear display.
- Avoid huge files (e.g. 4000 px wide) so the page stays fast.

**Summary:** Save each certificate as an image (JPG or PNG), name it `cert1.jpg`, `cert2.jpg`, `cert3.jpg`, or `cert4.jpg`, and put all four in this `certificates` folder. If you have a PDF, convert it to JPG or take a screenshot first.
