# Project screenshots

Add one screenshot per project so they show as covers on the portfolio:

- **project1.jpg** — Automatic Attendance System  
- **project2.jpg** — Financial Management System  
- **project3.jpg** — Online Cosmetics Shopping Website  
- **project4.jpg** — Online Website for Hardware Store  

Use `.jpg` or `.png`; if you use `.png`, update the file extension in `index.html` for that project. Images are displayed with `object-fit: cover` in a 4:3 box.
